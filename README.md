SwiftRiver is a free and open source platform for helping people to make sense of large amounts of information in a short amount of time. It is a mission to democratize access to the tools used to make sense of data - discover information that is authentic, accurate and above all, relevant - by providing the following capabilities:

* Gathering and filtering of information from a variety of channels e.g. RSS, Email, SMS, Twitter etc
* Drawing insights from the collected information
* Allowing people to create buckets of information using their own expectations of authority and accuracy as opposed to popularity.
